# game-tiers-3000

## Notes

Looks best in a browser window at least 1636 x 970

If I were continuing this I would handle the following:

* Create a component for the game titles
* Add transitions to draggable elements
* Tweak library grid so elements aren't so spread out
* Add the ability to sort tiers alphabetically
* Add a way to save sorted tiers
* Add support for keyboard controls
